# Pre-Project materials for 'Towards Understanding Features' project

This repository contains materials for a mini pre-project conducted as part of the 'Towards Understanding Features' (TUF) project (led by [Kola Ayonrinde](https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/)) during [AI Safety Camp](https://www.aisafety.camp/).

The materials here will focus on the paper [**Scaling and Evaluating Sparse Autoencoders**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04093).

## Focus of repository
The team roles for the project are based on those defined by John Wentworth in his [MATS Models article on LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nvP28s5oydv8RjF9E/mats-models). I will be working in a slightly hybrid role, taking on aspects of the 'experimentalist' role and aspects of the 'distillator' role.  

### Critique of style
Wearing my distillator hat, I will go through the paper, focusing primarily on the **style** rather than the **content** of the paper, and then answer the following questions:
  1. **What is effective about this paper's communication, and why?**
  2. **What could be improved about the way this paper communicates?**

[The critique of the paper's style can be found here.](docs/style_critique.md)

### Partial rewrite
I will also attemtp to rewrite the abstract section and one of the other sections (that I identified as being a good candidate for rewriting) to improve clarity and communication effectiveness.

[The partial rewrite of the paper can be found here](docs/rewrites.md)

### Experimental replication
I'll also focus on starting to get into gear as an experimentalist, and will aim to put together the code necessary to reproduce the central results of the paper.

### General notes
In addition to these role-specific tasks, I will compile some general notes on the paper itself Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in general, for my own learning and reference.
